# Initial Boot

Now that we have Arch Linux ARM on the micro sd card, safetly remove the micro sd card from your computer and put it into the raspberry pi 2.

It is assumed that you have a network that has:

* DHCP server
* DNS server
* Internet access

If you do not have these, you will have to configure your pi's networking interface manually, [link](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Network_configuration#Static_IP_address), and set the host file manually, [link](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Network_configuration#Local_network_hostname_resolution). You will also need to install some packages manually, [link](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Offline_installation_of_packages#A_simple_example).

Connect the ethernet to the pi and networking switch. Make sure the switch has an ethernet of it's own going to the internet.

If you have a hdmi display monitor, you may plug it into the pi.
